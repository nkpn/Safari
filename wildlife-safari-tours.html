                      <p>In Serengeti dawn is the best time to watch wildlife and for that matter you will have to get up early in the morning for  the morning game drive. The morning game drive is the best time to watch sunrise and cat families while actively hunting. Here in this area you will be able to see predators such as leopards and cheetahs, lions, and plenty of wildebeest and zebras. You’ll stop for a picnic lunch then continue with the game drive while heading towards Ngorongoro conservation area for the overnight stay at the lodge inside the area.                      </p>

You are likely to see many other animals and bird species like leopards, hippo, flamingos, antelopes and other small mammals of all kinds.
