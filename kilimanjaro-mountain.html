                    <p>Mount Kilimanjaro is a snow-capped peak rising above the savannah of Eastern Africa. With a summit of 19,341feet (5,895meters) from sea level is Africa's tallest mountain.  </p>
                    <p>The etymology of the name Kilimanjaro is still a mystery, several theories exist about the meaning and origin of the name. .</p>

                  <p>There are six routes officially sanctioned for climbing Kilimanjaro and two routes used for descent. These are; Machame, Marangu, Rongai, Lemosho, Umbwe, Shira and Mweka. The journey from the gate to the peak is like travelling from the equator to Antarctica in a matter of days. Clearest and warmest conditions from December to February, but also dry (and colder) from July -September</p>

                  <p>What is the best route to climb Kilimanjaro : Kilimanjaro has six well known routes and each route varies not only in length, time, cost and scenery but also has different difficult levels and different success rate. The most important decision to make as a climber is selecting the Kilimanjaro climb route. Which route up to Mount Kilimanjaro is good for you depends on a few factors: time and the budget, previous hiking/trekking experience and body fitness, time of the year and personal preference.</p>

            <p class="topic-description-text">Commonly known as the 'Coca-Cola' route; the route approaches Kilimanjaro from the southeast. It is the oldest, most established route and the most popular route to the summit of Kilimanjaro. The typical duration is either 5/6 days depending upon whether you chose to spend an extra day for acclimatization to the attitude. This is the only route that offers sleeping huts in dormitory-style.</p>

The cleared trail is the fastest way to Mandara but opportunities to see wildlife or enjoy the forest are limited due to the heavy foot traffic.

Horombo hut is a cluster of huts perched on a small plateau, with structures similar to Mandara, but with a total capacity of 120 climbers! The atmosphere at this stop is exciting; you will meet many people from all around the world all trying to reach the summit or who have already conquered the mighty mountain. This extra day and night are for additional acclimatization. We offer an additional walk towards the Mawenzi hut, passing the Zebra Rocks on the way (about 3 hours up and 1.5 hours down), to further assist with the process of acclimatization. Your day will end with an evening meal and rest at the campsite.</p>

                        <p>In the morning, I continued to trek through the alpine desert habitat. From Horombo there are two trails to the "Saddle" (which refers to the area located between the peaks of Mawenzi and Kibo). There is an upper route (right hand fork) and a lower route (left-hand fork) to choose from. The upper route (right-hand fork) will be very familiar, as you will have climbed most of it the previous day towards Mawenzi hut. It is very stony and eroded. The recommended lower route (left-hand fork) is much easier and nearly an hour shorter. From Kibo hut, the summit is only 1195 m above you and you will make your final ascent the same night. </p>

              Climbing Kilimanjaro on the Machame Route is considered to be more difficult than on the Marangu route or Rongai route. It is considered difficult, but not technically difficult.  Mostly it is a long and often steeper trek. It covers more ground and involves more ups and downs. It wears you out more, takes more energy, not more skills. BUT it offers much better ACCLIMATIZATION!</p>
            <p class="topic-description-text">Some people are worried about climbing the Barranco wall. Do not worry. It’s not a cliff face and it’s not a climb. It is mostly a very steep path that requires you to use your hands now and then with a bit of scramble in a couple of places.</p>

Living up to its name, there is a strong possibility of rain in the forest, which will transform the trail into a very soggy, muddy and slippery experience. You will arrive at the Machame campsite in the afternoon for dinner and rest.</p>

                        <p>The route now turns east into a semi-desert and rocky landscape surrounding Lava Tower. Before lunch, you will climb a rocky scree path to the Lava Tower (4630m). This first part of the day’s hike can take up to 5 hours. This will probably be your hardest day so far and some climbers may begin to feel the altitude. However, our experienced team will coach you through the symptoms and provide you with all the advice and support you need.</p>
                        <p>After lunch break by the Lava Tower, you’ll descent again by almost 680m towards the Barranco campsite whilst it may seem illogical to be going down at this point, you will quickly appreciate its true acclimatization benefit. This descent to Barranco camp takes about 2 hours, bringing the day’s hike to a total of about 7 hours. It’s a great opportunity to capture some beautiful memorable photographs of the Western Breach and Breach Wall.   At this sit of the camp, you will be able to have a rest and watch the sunset while waiting for evening dinner</p>

After midnight breakfast around 23:30hours, the trek begins to head in a north-westerly direction and ascend through a heavy screen towards Stella Point on the crater rim. Many climbers find this 6hours walk to the Stella point the most mentally and physically challenging aspect of the climb. At Stella Point (5,685m) your efforts will be rewarded with a short rest and the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting). From Stella Point you will normally encounter snow on ur 2-hour ascent to Uhuru Peak, the highest point in Africa and an achievement you will remember for the rest of your life.

            <h2>Rongai Route</h2>
            <p class="topic-description-text">The Rongai Route provides the ascent up Kilimanjaro from the northeastern side of the mountain, along the border between Tanzania and Kenya. </p>
            <p class="topic-description-text"> Rongai ascent is almost similar to Marangu. It is one of Kilimanjaro's easiest routes. The climb to the top is gradual and steady. However, unlike Marangu, this route has a low crowd and passes through remote wilderness areas. Due to its connection with Tsavo national park, it is the only route with a big possibility of seeing wildlife in the first days of the hike.</p>

                          <p>Takes 8hours to reach the Uhuru peak and another 6hours to descend to Horombo Hut. The part leading up towards the Kibo hut is steeper, the air is thin and mostly expected you will experience a lack of oxygen. The path then zigzags up to Gillman’s point (5681m) on the crater rim. Many climbers find this walk the most mentally and physically challenging aspect of the climb. From Stella Point you will normally encounter snow all the way on your 2-hour ascent to Uhuru Peak, the highest point in Africa and an achievement you will remember for the rest of your life. The walk back to Kibo hut from the summit takes about 3 hours. Here you will have a good ear earned but short rest and collect the rest of your gear, before heading down to Horombo hut.

It is a difficult and long route, but one that is favoured by most reputable Kilimanjaro outfitters due to its smaller crowds’ scenic variety and high success rates. </p>
            <p class="topic-description-text">The Lemosho route is one of the few where tourists’ groups maybe be accompanied on the first day by an armed ranger, like the forest around the Lemosho glades are rich in buffalo, elephant and other big game animals which normally enters the mountain forest from the Amboseli national park. Most climbers choose to use 7 days to climb (although 6 days is also possible if you lose the acclimatization day)</p>

                      <p>This is the most scenic route from the first day to the last. The trails begin north of Shira, also on the western side of the mountain. After registering at the gate you will enter the forest track using a 4WD vehicle to take you to Lemosho glades. Here you will have lunch then continue your walk to the Mti Mkubwa (big tree) campsite. But unlike the Shira route, where the first day you walk on a 4WD road, Lemosho is a narrow wilderness trail right from the beginning, passing through the pristine and remote rainforest with good chances of seeing wildlife. </p>

Once you reach the major ridge, you leave the forest behind and enter the moorland with its giant heathers as you work your way up towards the Shira Plateau. There are a couple more steep ridges, offering great views, a well-deserved break and a descent in the valley on the other side. Eventually, after some time, the path flattens out and before you know it you’ll be standing on the edge of the Shira Plateau, Kibo is straight ahead of you, the Shira Ridge to your right and you are overlooking the plateau below.</p>

This five-hour walk will probably be your hardest day so far and some climbers may begin to feel the altitude. However, our experienced team will coach you through the symptoms and provide you with all the advice and support you need. After lunch, you descend again by almost 680m to the Barranco camping area, whilst it may seem illogical to be going down at this point, you will quickly appreciate its true acclimatization benefit. The camp is situated in a valley below the Breach and Great Barranco Wall, which should provide you with a memorable sunset while you will be waiting for the dinner.                        </p>

You will quickly appreciate how beautiful the mighty Kilimanjaro is when you reach the bottom of the Heim Glacier. You will then head down through the Karanga Valley over the ridges and valleys, and join up with the Mweka route. After another hour or so, you reach Barafu (Swahili for Ice) Hut. This camp gives you a real experience of the icy elements. The camp is exposed to the ever-present gales; the tents are pitched on a narrow, stony ridge. The summit is now only a further 1345m up and you will make the final ascent the same night.

You will head in a north-westerly direction and ascend through a heavy scree towards Stella Point on the crater rim. Many climbers find this 6-hour walk to Stella point the most mentally and physically challenging aspect of the climb. At Stella Point (5685m) your efforts will be rewarded with a short rest and the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting). From Stella Point, you will normally encounter snow all the way on your 2-hour ascent to Uhuru Peak, the highest point in Africa where you will enjoy the magnificent views while taking a lot of time to do the memorable photographs.

              <p class="topic-description-text">This route is the hardest but most spectacular and direct way to reach Uhuru Peak. It follows a forested ridge to the moorlands and then traverses below the southern ice fields to reach the Barafu route which leads to the summit.  It is a relatively short, steep and scenic route</p>

                        <p>Pick up from the lodge drive from town towards Umbwe gate. After completing the gate registration procedures, the trek starts through the rainforest. There is a strong possibility of rain in the forest, which will transform the trail into a very soggy, muddy and slippery experience. Part of the trails on this day are so steep, they can only be negotiated because the tree routes provide something like steps. The tree roots also serve as handlebars to haul yourselves up where needed. You will have a lunch packed stop about halfway then you will continue to arrive at the camp in the late afternoon. Overnight at the campsite.</p>

                      <p>The day five starts with a climb up the Buffalo ridge and down into Porfu Camp where lunch is usually served. The route then continues east around the northern slopes to the Rongai Third Cave at 3,800 meters. The trek is shorter than the day before and by now you should be feeling well acclimated to the altitude. You will arrive at the Third Cave just around mid-afternoon. Meals will be served at the campsite where you will also spend the night.</p>

Trekkers then continue walking south-west up to School Hut (4,800 meters). After arriving at School Hut you will be served an early dinner and then you should get some shut-eye as you will be awoken before midnight to start your summit attempt. You’ll be advised by the guides to prepare your gears before going to bed ready for the early mid night summit trek.</p>

                        <p>You will wake up at midnight around 11:30am for a hot tea and some snacks, then begin the trek towards the steep incline up the slopes of Kibo under the cover of darkness.Your first check-point is Hans Meyer Cave where you will take a short break. The climb steepens as you approach Gilman’s Point (5,681 meters); which will be around 5-6 hours after departing School Hut. Take a moment to enjoy the approaching dawn and incredible view out and across to Mawenzi Peak, but remember you still have 2 hours trekking to reach Uhuru Peak so dig deep for the energy. The slope flattens as you head west around the crater rim and you should arrive at the summit at or just after sunrise. Your stay here will be brief so get as many pictures as you can of the incredible views and surrounding glaciers. You will then retrace your steps back around the crater rim to Stella Point (5,739 meters) where you will turn south and head down the heavily screed slopes of Kibo to Barafu Camp (4,680 meters). Most trekkers take a short break here before continuing down to Millennium Camp (3,950 meters) for your final night on the mountain. In total, you will be trekking for 14-16 hours on day eight so it is important to pace yourself, remain hydrated and keep your blood sugar levels up. You will have rest at the Millenium campsite along with dinner and overnight stay.                        </p>

              <h2>Trekking Mount Meru</h2>
              <p class="topic-description-text">This is the prominent volcano mountain with an elevation of 4566meters in the Arusha region of northeast Tanzania. Mount Meru is the second highest peak in Tanzania after Mount Kilimanjaro, which is just 60 km away and forms a backdrop to views from the park to the east. Although completely overshadowed by Kilimanjaro and frequently overlooked by many trekkers it is a spectacular volcanic cone with one of East Africa's most scenic and rewarding climbs.</p>

On arrival at the gate, the registration arrangement will be done before you start the trek up to Mt Meru accompanied by an armed park ranger. Walking through the grasslands towards the acacia forest on the southern route you might spot wildlife animals such as zebras and giraffes grazing on the lush vegetation. Roughly after 2hrs, you will reach the Maia Falls where you can have a break and stretch your legs while enjoying a picnic lunch. Thereafter the trek continues through the fig tree arch-an an unusual tree formation created by the wild fig Ficus Thonningii. The other 2hours will take you up to the Miriakamba Hut for dinner and overnight. </p>

                        <p>On this day you will continue the trek on wooden steps along the steep track. The shift in altitude brings about a noticeable drop in temperature and walking may seem easier. The low hanging clouds often shroud the rainforest in mist, creating a moody atmosphere in the lush vegetation. Your uphill trek will take you to “Mgongo wa Tembo” (elephant back) at a height of 3,200 m after approximately 2 hours, where you can take in the scenery and rest, before heading onward to Saddle Hut (3,550 m). On the way, while trekking you might find the vegetation changing from rainforest to heather and moorlands. At the saddle camp, you will decide to take a rest or have a one more hour hike to Little Meru to have a great view of Arusha National park and Kilimanjaro about 80km away. Dinner and Overnight at the Saddle Hut.

In the morning have your bags packed before breakfast. Generally breakfast is between 7:30am and 8:00am, and departure from camp is at 9:00am after medical checkup. There is lunch at midday, tea and biscuits around 4pm and dinner at 7pm. </p>

After you assemble your day pack, you will begin walking around 8:00 AM, while the porters stay behind to clean up the campsite, and pack up the tents and other equipment.</p>

Nights especially can be very chilly  and a water and a windproof jacket and warm pullover are essential. Particularly on Kilimanjaro, waterproof everything especially your sleeping bag, as things rarely dry on the mountain. Kilimanjaro can be climbed throughout the year but it is worth avoiding the two rainy seasons (late March to mid June and October to beginning of December) when the trails become slippery .
